A simple and nice looking To-Do-List with Javascript

Go and try the app here:
https://simple-todolist1.firebaseapp.com

This started as a project coded along at the Web Developer Bootcamp online course by Colt Steele on Udemy using jQuery. You can see the original project in /old-but-working-project
As I liked the look and feel of it, I refactored it by myself using React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
